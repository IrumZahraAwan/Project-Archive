dotfiles
========

A backup of all my config files.

OS: Arch Linux x86_64

Kernel Release: 3.12.8-1-ARCH

WM: xmonad

DE: None



Software used:

 xmonad (tiling window manager)
 xmobar (status bar)
 firefox (with custom styling)
 vimperator (firefox plugin)
 homepage.py (github.com/ok100)
 xterm (terminal)
 tty-clock
 vim (text-editor)
 feh (background-image)
 scrot (screenshot)


-Scripts/theme.py takes two colours as an input and changes multiples files to use those colours.


Based on many other configs I have seen on the internet.
