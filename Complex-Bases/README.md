Complex-Bases
=============

Visualisation of Complex Bases using Argand diagrams.
Each pixel represents an integer latice.

Produced by listing integers in the complex base, converting the integer into decimal and plotting it. The colour represents how many digits it has in the complex base representation (ie the powers of the base).

###Example

For 1+1i, the number of digits used will be 2: 0,1.  (2 is the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts)

The first few integers are:

* 0 = 0+0i = (0,0)
* 1 = 1+1i = (1,1)
* 10 = 0+2i = (0,2)
* 11 =  1+3i = (1,3)
* 100 = -2+2i  = (-2,2)
* 101 = -1+3i  = (-1,3)
* 110 = -2+4i  = (-2,4)
* 111 =  -1+5i = (-1,5)

Continuing this, it will end up looking like:
(The black is the background - this is where the negative integers would be)
