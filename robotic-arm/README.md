Robotic Arm
===

This robotic arm was an assignment in a year 11 and 12 engineering class at Dickson College, ACT.
The group I was working with included myself and Andreas Vlachos.

The goal of this project was to develop a robotic arm using recycled materials.

(No close-up photos of the final operational arm were taken. However, the arm is still at Dickson College.
